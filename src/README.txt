This is a weather application by using React.js library

React has its own environment to run.
Open the terminal and find the weather-react dc
Then, npm start

1. Type in any city in the search bar, for example, Boston.
   Press "Enter" key on your keyboard.
   Weather information shows up including the current date, today's
   temperature, what the weather looks like, clouds, clear, mist, etc.
2. Put your cursor on the temperature box, there is a hover box showing
   What degree feels like.
3. If you type in a city which is warmer(>16Â°c), the background will be
   Changed to that warmer background, try Singapore.

Enjoy my weather application!
